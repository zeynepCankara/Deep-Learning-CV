# HW4 â€• Deep Learning in Videos

### Description
- trimmed action recognition and temporal action segmentation in full-length videos via deep learning.

### Submission Format
 
 1.   `hw4_report.pdf`  
The report of your homework assignment.  
 1.   `hw4_p1.sh`  
The shell script file for data preprocessing. This script takes as input two folders: the first one contains the video data, and the second one is where you should output the label file named `p1_valid.txt`.
 1.   `hw4_p2.sh`  
The shell script file for trimmed action recognition. This script takes as input two folders: the first one contains the video data, and the second one is where you should output the label file named `p2_result.txt`.
 1.   `hw4_p3.sh`  
The shell script file for temporal action segmentation. This script takes as input two folders: the first one contains the video data, and the second one is where you should output the label files named `<video_category>.txt`. Note that you should replace `<video_category>` accordingly, and a total of **7** files should be generated in this script.

Running the files:

**Problem 1**

    bash ./hw4_p1.sh $1 $2 $3
-   `$1` is the folder containing the ***trimmed*** validation videos (e.g. `TrimmedVideos/video/valid/`).
-   `$2` is the path to the ground truth label file for the videos (e.g. `TrimmedVideos/label/gt_valid.csv`).
-   `$3` is the folder to which you should output your predicted labels (e.g. `./output/`). Please do not create this directory in your shell script or python codes.

**Problem 2**

    bash ./hw4_p2.sh $1 $2 $3
-   `$1` is the folder containing the ***trimmed*** validation/test videos.
-   `$2` is the path to the ground truth label file for the videos (e.g. `TrimmedVideos/label/gt_valid.csv` or `TrimmedVideos/label/gt_test.csv`).
-   `$3` is the folder to which you should output your predicted labels (e.g. `./output/`). Please do not create this directory in your shell script or python codes.

**Problem 3**

    bash ./hw4_p3.sh $1 $2
-   `$1` is the folder containing the ***full-length*** validation videos.
-   `$2` is the folder to which you should output your predicted labels (e.g. `./output/`). Please do not create this directory in your shell script or python codes.
 

### Packages
This homework should be done using python3.6 and you can use all the python3.6 standard libraries. For a list of third-party packages allowed to be used in this assignment, please refer to the requirments.txt for more details.
You can run the following command to install all the packages listed in the requirements.txt:

    pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Note that using packages with different versions will very likely lead to compatibility issues, so make sure that you install the correct version if one is specified above. E-mail or ask the TAs first if you want to import other packages.
